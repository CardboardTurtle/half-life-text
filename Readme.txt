=========={THANK YOU FOR DOWNLOADING MY GAME!}==========
As a fan of the Half Life series, and of a twitch streamer/youtuber "Jolly Wangcore," I thought that since I was learning C programming, I should put my skills to the test and create a full game. Of course, I'm bad at programming, so something simple and easy to write like a text adventure game was the obvious choice for practicing my programming skills, as well as creating something that people may enjoy.

This game was entirely written in the C programming language, and from a beginner, who, when this project started, only had a week or two experience. This game is a testament to how easy it is to learn programming, as well as how good the C programming language is. it is the best language. do not question me on this or i will be moderately upset.

This next section is the start of the story. Feel free to skip it if you have already played the game. You start the game inside the tram.

Also, use Linux.

=========={HOW TO PLAY (VERY very VERY very VERY very IMPORTANT)}==========

Don't be an idiot, you will likely die.

Don't use spaces. everything will be one word. "walk to door" becomes "walktodoor." This is because i'm bad at programming and only know how to do this. In later revisions, i might change that.

TO MOVE: type "walkto" and then what you want to walk to. "walktodoor", "walktodesk", "walktoantimassspectrometer", etc.

TO GRAB/TAKE: type "grab" and then the option. "grabglock", "grabcart", "grabpenis", etc.

TO SHOOT GUN: type "shoot" and then the target. "shootheadcrab", "shootvortigaunt", "shootself", etc.

TO USE THINGS (like pressing buttons, climbing ladders, etc "useladder", "usebutton", "usecrowbar", etc.

TO HIT THINGS WITH CROWBAR: "hitheadcrab", "hitself", "hitcrate", etc.

=========={STORY}==========

You are in a tram, late for work. at the Black Mesa research facility, in New Mexico. You are Gordon Freeman, a 27 year old theoretical physicist who graduated from MIT. From the speakers in the roof, a voice speaks.

Tram: "Good morning and welcome to the Black Mesa Transit System. This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of employees of the Black Mesa Research Facility personnel. Please feel free to move about the train or simply sit back and enjoy the ride.

The time is 8:47 AM. Current topside temperature is 93 degrees, with an estimated high of one hundred and five. The Black Mesa compound is maintained at a pleasant 68 degrees at all times.

This train is inbound from Level 3 dormitories to Sector C Test Labs and Control Facilities. If your intended destination is a high-security area beyond Sector C, you will need to return to the Central Transit hub in Area 9 and board a high-security train. If you have not yet submitted your identity to the retinal clearance system, you must report to Black Mesa Personnel for processing before you will be permitted into the high-security branch of the transit system.

Due to the high toxicity of material routinely handled in the Black Mesa compound, no smoking, eating, or drinking are permitted within the Black Mesa Transit System.

Please keep your limbs inside the train at all times. Do not attempt to open the doors until the train has come to a complete halt at the station platform. In the event of an emergency, passengers are to remain seated and await further instruction. If it is necessary to exit the train, disabled personnel should be evacuated first. Please stay away from electrified rails, and proceed to an emergency station until assistance arrives.

A reminder that the Black Mesa Hazard Course decathlon will commence this evening at nineteen hundred hours in the Level 3 facility. The semifinals for high-security personnel will be announced in a separate Secure Access transmission. Remember, more lives than your own may depend on your fitness.

Do you have a friend or relative who would make a valuable addition to the Black Mesa team? Immediate openings are available in the areas of Materials Handling and Low-Clearance Security. Please contact Black Mesa Personnel for further information. If you have an associate with a background in the areas of theoretical physics, biotechnology or other high-tech disciplines, please contact our Civilian Recruitment Division. The Black Mesa Research Facility is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

A reminder to all Black Mesa personnel: Regular radiation and biohazard screenings are a requirement of continued employment in the Black Mesa Research Facility. Missing a scheduled urinalysis or radiation check-up is grounds for immediate termination. If you feel you have been exposed to radioactive or other hazardous materials in the course of your duties, contact your Radiation Safety Officer immediately. Work safe, work smart. Your future depends on it."

The voice stops speaking as you arrive on your platform in the Sector C test labs, ready to start your day. Your task of the day? "routine testing of anamalous materials." You need to get the HEV suit in the scientist locker room, and then go to the test chamber to begin the test. A security guard is a approaching the tram to open the door.
